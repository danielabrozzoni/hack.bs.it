hack.bs is a non-profit [cypherpunk]({{< ref "cypherpunks" >}}) hackerspace located in Brescia, Italy. Our mission is to provide a space where people can learn about Bitcoin, technology, open-source, privacy and freedom, and connect with other like-minded individuals.

We are a space for hackers, designed by hackers.

We are funded through voluntary contributions from individuals and private companies: if you want to support our project consider [making a donation]({{< ref "donate" >}}).
We have a [transparency]({{< ref "transparency" >}}) page to show exactly how we allocate our funds.

## How it works

Our hackerspace lives in the night, from 5PM to 5AM in the weekdays, and all day in the weekends. Only members can enter the space - the membership cost is 10â‚¬/year. Just a few trusted people have the keys to the space, so if you're not part of the hackbs elite ping us before coming.

We are working on deploying a Matrix server, but in the meantime, feel free to send us a message either on our Instagram/Twitter, or on Telegram to [@danielabrozzoni](t.me/danielabrozzoni) or [@afilini](t.me/afilini).

## Community

Our community is currently composed of 30-ish people, including developers, engineers, designers, students, researchers, and all-rounders. We're always excited to welcome new talent - whether you're an expert or just starting out, come say hi!

## Founders

hack.bs is the creation of [Alekos Filini](https://twitter.com/afilini) and [Daniela Brozzoni](https://twitter.com/danielabrozzoni).
